## Problem Statement

After business hours, databases and storage facilities could easily get crowded with papers and files, making their manual processing laborious and time-consuming. This makes it necessary to use machine learning techniques to automate this operation. Clustering analysis will be used in this study to address this sampling some Wikpedia articles.

Prerequisites: Knowledge of clustering techniques or previous elbow method use are prerequisites for finishing this assignment, but both are greatly advantageous.

The idea of clustering techniques or prior experience utilizing the elbow approach is a great advantage.

## Approach
We will employ a Wikipedia Python library made availabe for easy access to Wikipedia pages. We deal with 14 articles using elbow method which employs heurisics and then K-Mean algorithm for clustering.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 14 articles including topics which are:
* Analytics
* Lawsuit
* Military
* Economy
* Health
* Education
* Food
* Languages
* Africa
* Countries
* Finance
* Earth
* Agriculture
* Plants

All the articles are imported and first converted into vectors for suitability.
